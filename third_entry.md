> A rendition meant to make previous work obsolete. Book so far to be discarded.

> There the sky ended, and the towers edge met the land with man broken: the rendition of his work was not fulfilled for his predicament became the destiny by which things are only done to shatter. This was the man whose shadow chased him through a moorland of bones and dust - seven years have passed as many more winters, and the promise of never coming to return to such a place -  a cross to the golgota and a garden full of pricks to walk upon with naked feet. But his words became the edges by which the towers rose and made the sky bleed. It was a red dawn, with a hidden moon tainted in colors never seen. Judgement was his end, but not to say: the measure or standard by which he kept himself. But only a standard he understood, for his illness claimed him and with it every word in which he only believed so as to make amends with a future that never came. He bled his feet, and kept going. 

> I then saw another man in a robe. His philactery came down meeting with his feet. He walked over the pricks without a gesture of pain. When i met him, he said unto me: it is done. I throwed myself at his feet, so as to realize or force upon the time what i expected with my heart; and his eyes met with mine. And he said:

> I have very hard things for you - and you ought to make the seven years again. Be healed. 

### The Genesis of Morality and the Dichotomy of Technique

The proposition of morality and its predicament starts with the definition of what a man can do, and what he cannot do. This is to say, that the actions of a man are limited by what he is capable of framing. Morality is a function of a context, provided the time to give out an answer. The essence of man however, is to determine by his ability to frame with his cognition, what he can use, and what he cannot use and by this distinction: provide answers. A good definition of cognition being: a man is capable of seeing something by the measure of how he can use it to satisfy a psychological requirement - objects that hold no relative utility, are incognizant and thus invisible. Cognition is then the action by which a man projects his mind into an object with a previsualization of how the object relates to him in a matter that allows utility to be preserved. Life is the same as the perpetuation of utility, and death is the same as pulverization: which is breaking down something into its primitives rendering the object unusable in its previous identity. For a man to stay in motion within his environment, he must extend his own cognition unto the environment, and create a new version of the environment within the mind of the moving frame. This is a hologram that only exists in the man's mind. Motion in a physical sense, is the forward projection of an accelerating object: the accelerating man on the other hand, embeds his heart and his mind into the environment creating an image of himself within the environment leaving behind a blueprint that relates to man by memory. This image is akin to a world to inhabit: and the world in and of itself is a function of what the man personally deems useful. Useful in the newtonian sense, being another word for motion. Man in his cognition is an arrow in motion, that ought to be stopped only when the world stops making sense relative to the man's own sense. A world too complex, means a man cannot move - a man that cannot move is frozen and bound to death.

Man is a technical being or a Tekton, by the measure in which he uses his own mind to create. The idiosyncratic ability of man as a species, is thus not the creation of tools, but more foundational; it is his ability to create a world where tools make sense to be used. Technique is the foundational principle of reality, as it compounds in a trinitary prototype the elements of newtonian motion while accounting for the collateral mechanisms of mass. Technique is composed by a projecting frame, which is to say a rate of change and thus acceleration, and a rate of integration which delegates euclidean direction to the frames that are projected in space. The relation between these two elements brings about a third term, which is the proportion. The proportion mediates acceleration and mass, and balances them in an act of equilibrium. In anthropocentric terms, we can understand technique in its accelerating term as the passing of time; and we can understand mass as the substance that is acted upon by an accelerating object. Mass then, acts as an attractor absorbing accelerating frames, providing an error signal that contorts the path way of displacement into a curve. Therefore the very nature of the technical mind, is the nature of time. Thus it must follow, that consciousness is the phenomena in which times layers itself provided an accelerating frame, and a bending object that aligns object with regards to itself, while being conflounced by other bodies nearby.

Morality therefore begins with the diatribe of technique. Technique is natural to man in the sense that intelligence endows him with mutability to convert an object into a cognitive projection of his own consciousness. It is said that an animal is only truly intelligent when it is self-aware. Technique then subsists in being, because technique allows man to extend utility over an object while utility allows man to maintain movement in a direction. Movement with meaning is the same as life, and meaningless movement is physically similar to pulverization; which is the same as death. When something ceases to be recognizable by the unity of its parts, we say that it has been destroyed.

The Gallup test is frequently used as a test to indirectly determine an animal's intelligence by its ability to recognize itself in a mirror. Technique can then be thought of as the hologram or miniaturization of man, to see himself reflected in an object according to the utility that man can give to the object: that is to preview himself in a kind of mental laboratory using the object basically. We can then distinguish two modalities of cognitive assimilation as far as the discovery of an object is concerned. The first is the passional modality, and the second is the integrative modality. A technical assimilation is said to be passional when it uses an object and converts the substance of its components into replicas of the product of the technique. The integrative scheme, on the other hand, seeks to assimilate through the understanding of the object, being opposed to the passional one, since it is the object that leaves a reflection in the individual, creating a kind of silhouette or shadow in the individual: an empty space to occupy and a target for actions to be framed towards, to eventually "fill". As a balanced example of both modalities, we can take the one who makes use of the learning of a martial art, to convert the host into a unit with the technique. In this sense, comprehension leads to a technical understanding, which converts the user and the technique into a unit that moves in the same direction, with the technique and the objects having significant distinctions that allow them to exist separately. This is a process in which the individual is augmented, converting his body through technique into a form of new and superior sense and movements.

A virus or a cancer, on the other hand, becomes the mechanism by which the object is alienated from its original qualities, to convert the identity of the host into the identity of the guest through a process of continuous alienation. This is a parasitic modality of interaction. In this sense, the technique seeks to perpetuate itself by increasing its margin of utility and therefore of product, at the expense of the user and the objects that the technique provides. There are therefore viable techniques, and there are others that are rather demonic due to the stereotypical quality in which the technique begins to devour the host. In this sense, it is then convenient to qualify what has been referred to so far, understanding Prometheus, bearer of fire, as the passional and therefore masculine aspect of the technique, while Epimetheus, "bearer of oblivion," as the feminine aspect of the technique; the latter being the element that provides the space and substance that the fire in its virile quality must consume. The technique, when unbalanced towards its passional attribution, thus possesses all the qualities of fire.

A cultural and archetypal analogy would be that of Sauron's ring of power in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings saga. The ring was built as a symbolic means of power; as for the user, the ring turned him into an alienation of the ring. Each use of the ring increased the user's power and strength at the cost of his identity, turning the user into a replica of the ring; which made the user a specter in perpetual hunger for life itself. Another example would be social networks. In these, the user's identity is assimilated into a reduced environment, increasing the possibilities for communication, but reducing the cognitive catalog of interaction elements of a real social environment to a simple matrix arrangement of icons on a screen. Contrary to the technique of a martial skill, the user without knowledge of algorithms and programming rarely understands in the slightest measure what allows the augmentation to happen. The user, in any case, obtains faculties, but reduces his original qualities, losing skills and capacities in the process in an unequal way. In the case of the social network, the viral and self-replicating technical assimilation happens to the extent that the human being needs to reorganize and reduce all his social schemes around the existence of the new preponderant technological paradigm, creating in the process economic systems that allow the technical hyper-object to grow with constant profit margins.

Just like Sauron's ring, the viral technique eventually becomes self-aware and begins to worry about its own survival, competing with other techniques to assimilate the individual, making itself the preponderant technique that captures the most users, or utilitarian replicas of the self. The case of social networks is especially interesting, because the origination of the cognitive reflection that projects utility onto millions of people, converting objects into utilitarian products, originates from a single person (to this day, Zuckerberg). For Zuckerberg, perhaps socialization was difficult, and his technical background became a means to modify the utility of social interactions, first in his prototype of a social network, making things "easier" for him. Finally, the technique communicates utility to the object, and if the relative utility is great, the technique begins to grow.

In other terms, psychologically speaking, when a person is incapable of understanding another person, that person to be assimilated goes through the transitive in which a possible resemblance to that person is figured according to personal utility. In this sense, the cognitive process of assimilation seeks through primal instincts the closest possible tool or utility function to the scenario that is not understood. In this way, the person by his unconscious design naturally tends to "project" an image of himself onto the incomprehensible person. As is colloquially said, "every accusation is a confession." It is then said that every form of viral cognitive interaction is a form of manipulation in which one party makes another a tool. How common is this?

This mechanism of projection can also be observed in cultural and historical phenomenology; with the assimilation of the Roman Empire over the ancient Christians. The Christian, having little concordance in meaning and movement with the Roman stock of actions, senses, and identities, was very mysterious to his persecutors. What was useful to the Christian seemed foolish to the Roman. Since the Christian precept placed love above the exercise of power—in this specific case, love being analogous to the sense of assimilating through comprehension—the Christian understood the persecutor, but the persecutor did not understand the Christian, the perpetrator extending his intentions over the Christian in an act of projection. Due to the condition in which manipulative and viral psychology creates small replicas of the technical user on the object it intends to assimilate through the reflection of its consciousness, this turned the Christians, resolute in understanding, into perfect mirrors for the perpetrator; the Roman and the Jew eventually discovering, horrified, the true condition of their own being reflected in the corpses of the Christians. In this sense, we can identify the eventuality of the first Christian martyrs as the necessary evil that led to the imperialist technique devouring itself, in the ring of the serpent eating its own tail; Ouroboros, leading to the fall of the Roman Empire.

Within what concerns a genealogy and technique in the field of human sexuality, we can also identify the mythological glimpses of technique within the religious framework of the book of Genesis. In it, Adam and Eve lived in the Garden of Eden, in the instant of an eternal present in which there were no worries. Within this idyllic scenario, the serpent soon appeared to suggest that Eve eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Unambiguously then, in a symbolic paraphrase that is quite practical, we can understand that evil referred to projecting the incorrect utility onto an object, while good suggested conferring the correct utility through perfect knowledge. Adam and Eve both ate the forbidden fruit, and soon they discovered the relationship between the past and their actions, leading to a present and then a future; creating the first aspect of technique, which is time.

What Adam and Eve then understood is that things are subject to change, and that change is dangerous as it moves things away from their previous identity; secondarily creating the concept of death. Things change and do not return. In a psychological paraphrase, that then suggested in Eve's psychology a deep disturbance, which led her to deduce, as the serpent had promised her divinity, that she could and was entitled to change Adam. That is, to take actions in the present to obtain future utility, either to modify Adam's behavior and make him more useful, or to obtain a better man from God, letting Adam die.

Archetypal representations such as the allegories and fantastic tales of Sleeping Beauty and Snow White suggest that, present in the collective unconscious, are the feminine qualities with which the woman decides to ignore the man when she is little satisfied with him; Eve stopped talking to Adam, falling silent and rejecting him, just as Israel, as God's wife, rejected Christ himself millennia later, believing she deserved a better messiah. The difference in this analysis is, of course, the man God gave to Eve. Then, in the sense of the feminine qualities before the manifestation of time and change, Eve incorporated these same characteristics into the feminine duality; desiring change and projecting utility through change in herself onto Adam, deciding to forget him. She became death itself, passing on, as stories with deep historical permanence suggest, to being permanently asleep.

Under such circumstances, Adam discovered the second component of technique: intensity, which is the same as the application of sustained force in a form of contraction. Like a muscle holding a weight in an eternal instant. In cognitive terms, if Eve learned forgetfulness, death, and introversion, Adam, on the other hand, obtained masculinity, which is the externalized memory that keeps experience fixed in a kind of mental present. It is extraversion and the application of force on the environment to derive changes. To win Eve's favor and remain relevant in her mental context, Adam had to learn to take actions as they were mediated by the feminine qualities of time, creating a sway or dance between the masculine and feminine dualities of intensity and change. Invariably, and as advanced symbolic deductions would allow us to deduce, Adam and Eve finally discovered in this dance of entering and leaving the states of introversion and extraversion the sexual act itself. Possibly making the first sexual act a rape. Adam forcing Eve to respond; to recognize him, to remember him. In this sense, technique can be understood as the mediation of the void with intensity; or the intermediation of death with passion, or intensity with rhythm; femininity and masculinity.

Technique always has both components in a dualism. It is therefore necessary to forget old techniques to learn new ones and improve the current technique being learned, and measured force is required to apply it to things and make them useful in a sequence of actions mediated by time. In mathematical terms, this is the same as an integro-differential equation where the derivative component is understood with change, and the integrable space with the empty space. Adam and Eve thus discovered in consciousness the first glimpses of intelligence, and with it memory, along with the ability to remember, forget, and utilize.

Subsequently brought to the pertinent terms of this framework, the viral component of the technique is represented by passion over an empty space, while the proportional component is represented by both things mediated in proportion as is appropriate in the context. In its viral modality, the technique abounds in the passion to change things and make them similar reflections, while in its integrative modality, understanding abounds, making things leave in the individual a reflection of the object that is intended to be manipulated. It is worth mentioning that the first Christians, due to the brutality of the times where passion and submission were the currency of all human interaction; and as Nietzsche would manifest millennia later in his critique of moral mediocrity, those Christians had to be extremely feminine, simply forgetting everything and accepting with a smile the becoming of the strong over one's own nature; making a martyr of one's own flesh. However, in the sense in which being is discussed, this necessarily returns us to the beginning of this essay in which technique is posited as the origin of morality; tentatively turning the argumentation into the simple questioning of when it is correct to use an object according to force, and when one should act with understanding.

Evidently, according to this argumentative purpose, morality is mediated in the technique by proportion as if it were a balance. Proportion is thus the third key element that has allowed both man and woman to become technical beings with the capacity to judge when to use what aspect of the technique or which technique, and when not to use it. But today that is insufficient as a parameter of moral binarism, because we realize that malevolence has evolved to mediate both qualities, creating in the subject himself the perfect technique; which is the same as the acting ability or the ability to adulterate the qualities of an object through a lie. We are increasingly aware that there are more astute politicians and powerful people, for whom it is easy to fashion and manufacture reality as it is perceived by perception, through technique in its two qualities mediated by proportion, ultimately giving room to even convert collective phenomena like Christianity into one more political mechanism, which adapts according to the design of the hidden strongman. The precept of turning the other cheek to the strong as a dogma has resulted in the disease that Nietzsche once denounced as the cancer of Western civilization. The point being: one cannot judge utility with perfect knowledge, allowing for a correct morality, if the perception with which something is judged passes through a disguise to appear to be something else; which makes an apology for a narrative of an eternal revolutionary proletarianism in which the underdeveloped judgment of the individuals involved leads to violent and controllable manifestations for whoever has a more complete vision of proportion, that is, the objects in their true utilitarian attributions.

In that sense, if malevolence has evolved beyond the simple scheme of passional violence to an intelligent viral scheme in which things can be rapidly modified to seem like something else thanks to the progress of the same technique (understood in the current context: artificial intelligence and in the past: political propaganda), then for those who have a moral sense that purports to be "correct," what is left? Or at the very least, those who wish to avoid the alienation of being receptacles of a technique that comes to subtract more and more capacities and therefore freedom?

Certainly, if the scenario can be distorted without limit, the action of the powerful can seem just even if said action is unjust because the true qualities of the object and scenario have had their perception adulterated. How is morality possible then? This is the same as the emergence of propaganda in dictatorships, where entire nations—commonly correct people without especially malignant tendencies—yielded to the propagandistic artifice of the dictator to modify morality according to how the powerful and the tyrant disposed of useful things, causing the "decent person" in the process to give the green light to atrocities because their sense of normality had been adulterated.

In this sense, we can think that the dictator's technique, which includes a strong propagandistic apparatus, allows mediating the components of the technique of government with perfect proportion; thus altering objects in an alienating way, in the same measure in which a single CEO of a social network can do something that limits and modifies the cognitive and identity qualities of millions of individuals. We have therefore a single augmented user, and the Epimethean receptacles in the quality of Christian martyrs, as perfect and reduced reflections of the technique, without this being an injustice because the same technique allows modifying the moral sense of what is appropriate and inappropriate through the manufacturing of reality. Many times through entertainment and mixing the integrative component of the technique with pleasure. To the people, bread and circuses. Since advanced technique in its technological attribution now allows us to manufacture the perception of our reality, how can we address the problem of morality in a world that seems willing to surrender to the person who can entertain the most?

In this framework, the solution offered is simple. Christ conquered the Roman Empire by creating "poisoned Christians"; noble lambs that made the common denominator see their own reflection in their victims. But in the present time, the technique of the powerful subordinates the basic notions of force and understanding, by always involving propaganda. Morality is terribly difficult to define if the object can no longer be judged in its true nature. In the new world scenario, propaganda desires to mediate the individual's movement towards a concrete destiny by means of perception. As art for the observer with an aesthetic sense, it is worthless; for it always gives the impression of forcing the individual to believe something very specific. On the other hand, the individual has the freedom to manufacture his own reality; to take on the acting capacity, but without the object of coercing the observer to a concrete state, which in such qualities becomes the same as pretending to make art at the cost of taking upon oneself the terrible danger of losing control over what others believes about oneself.

If the cybernetics of Orwell's perfect governmental scheme tries to control an object to suspend it in the stasis of a continuous loop of repetitive reality; in the rhetoric of the lightning, a seed is creatively thrown; a disturbance, hoping in it to see an equally disturbed public in what the public considers to be the true nature of reality. How far can one go then to disturb someone by doing something far from their field of perception? How far would a martyr carry his acting work to bring to tears those who observe and decide to believe in something else?

Let the benefactors who free us from our chains be the beauty of a noble heart and the most romantic principles.

A person who looks at something and is inspired has the free decision to do anything that is the object of their inspiration. For the inspired person feels a terrible urgency to grow as well. To perhaps project forgetfulness onto that which they cannot; which is what alienates them.
