# The Philosopher's Stone: One Science to Bend Them All

I've often been involved as a passive listener in groups where I didn't have much resonance: mainly shared beliefs. I participated nonetheless because I thought some perspective about their creed was interesting. On these endeavors, I would often challenge myself with a question: _Why would this group exist in the first place, and what about this group is symptomatic of society overall?_

A group I would like to juxtapose with the main idea of this entry is the New Age movement. At its idealistic core, it portrays humankind as a project of sorts, in which integration with a higher responsibility—and thus contact with other "alien" species—would be possible only if mankind achieved some sort of transcendental quality. Namely, mastery over an overused term with which we are all familiar with: love.

The "alien conundrum" that grabs most people's attention in this set of beliefs I didn't find interesting, because it essentially delegates the task of salvation to a foreign agency. This is a pattern we have already been through multiple times: the idea that a messiah can do the hard homework for us. In sheer honesty, I must confess that I don't care about aliens because my life's fixation is on what people are doing and how their doing becomes an identity or a definition of who they are, and not what they say. In this sense, I consider my life's responsibility to reframe problems so people can jump to a different perspective—a manner in which the battlefield is tilted to their advantage so _they are willing to do what they were born to do._

In the sense of identity and purpose, however, words are not only dangerous but a commodity that allows you to bypass reality with a lie. Verbs manifested through actions will always trump nouns and adjectives—it's best to live life by either "yes" or "no." The rest, as Jesus would say, comes from an adversarial proposition in which reality is bent to become something it probably is not.

But I digress. What's truly worth rescuing about the New Age in the current times of accelerationism is its proposition of morality and how, in a celestial conflict of sorts, there's a fundamental distinction between "alien alliances" based on their relationship with regards to authority. Here, morality falls into classical binarism: there are the good guys, who allow you to live your life with sovereignty and want you to learn lessons on your own. No matter how painful the experience, they never offer a helping hand because each last second has infinite value to them. And then there are the "dark species," in which morality is a function of stability, practicality, and authority.

This binarism is very interesting because it reflects a fundamental aspect of reality, which is our relationship to authority. In essence, the "bad guys" want you to become an embodiment of your boss: an appendix or an extension. The "good guys" want you to learn how to become like your current leader—moving up through a hierarchy as a measure of how you can be of service to others: paradoxially the higher you are, the more inverted the pyramid is.

## Technique and the Moral Binary
This morality binarism, I learned, is the fundamental key to how each of the sides relate to technique and, by extension, technology. The "good species" forbid the use of computers, while the dark species employ mechanisms like computers and A.I. to their fullest extent. The reason why is simple: the code that goes into a computer program is essentially a means to communicate full ownership and authority over a subject—the subject in this case being the computer. Thus, the controlled subject is a perfect extension of the author.

The "good guys," on the other hand, rely on interfacing with reality through the act of speaking while letting things keep their original essence. When you are using a computer, you are telling it with **cabal precision** what to do. But in the other perspective, you are allowing the thing you wish to control not to become alienated by your own authority: you let it be, but talk it through an argument so it decides to temporarily align with your intentions. Nature then becomes your ally because you are worth it, not because you coerce it.

Computers are, unsurprisingly, considered to be completely evil in the New Age moral dichotomy. Not because computers are evil by an attribute of their essence as techniques (I personally love computers and LLMs), but by the power they enable as they express authority in a way that allows no exceptions. The problem, however, is that morality can be mostly reduced to deciding what to do with time provided a context. A good understanding of context that is far-reaching is full of exceptions. Namely, a lot of people over the history of mankind had to endure "looking bad" for the right cause because they understood causality farther than anybody else. The bad guys will often "look good" doing whatever they are doing but miss the mark at the long game of evolution, which is the game of learning.

Here, the good guys in this galactic cosmovision seem to understand it better because they proverbially want the game of learning to go on forever, and they reflect this understanding properly in the means they technically operate. By the account of some authors, they store memory in living crystals instead of hard drives, their "spaceships" are living beings, and their warfare is waged through psychic means, persuading reality through speech to rain fire on enemies—not laser blasters or nuclear bombs.

## Machine Learning and the Math of Wisdom
Essentially, this moral difference opens up a debate on Machine Learning. The New Age people often say that A.I. is the science of perfect authority and thus the science of evil. But I personally disagree.

The highest form of knowledge is experience or wisdom, and wisdom splits the sea with regards to the hardness of a problem. A wise person will know the solution to a hard problem they have practiced for in a glance, while the inexperienced person will spend more time trying to figure it out. The act of gathering fitness with regards to a problem is called learning, and as mathematics advanced over the 20th century, we also came to understand the math of learning through statistical learning.

Now heres the dealbreaker: the mathematics of learning are the most broken hack to reality that could possibly exist (as if the hack was stolen from the gods themsevles), as it allows a person to learn indefinitely from a problem. Learning is the foundation of technique, and thus the foundation of all possible reality.

Now, in anthropocentric terms, if the learning function of a human being is a function of personality, then it also follows that any personality theory that allows your persona to be contorted into a different one temporarily to acquire specialized knowledge and then new perspectives is the key to unlock the reality of humanity itself. You can see this clearly in multiplayer games where the player is asked to be specialized into a class AKA personality. The player who specializes yet has played all the other classes in the game is the best player and the one who's going to win you the match because they can anticipate scenarios and know the outcomes of problems beforehand. The "good guys of the galaxy" see it the same way. You get a higher ranking in their hierarchy by measure of how much you understand other people by _living their lives_.

Thus, the case is the following: if you are a math person, you will eventually find learning theory with its trinary prototype of reality (function, weights, and label), regardless of being implemented on a computer or not, **everywhere** - i'd then argue that Machine Learning, even in the optics of New Age groups is not evil - it just depends wether the practictioner is going to execute it cabally on a computer or on a living being. And if you are not a "quant" person, then knowing personality frameworks will allow you to jump between the worlds of all sorts of people while gathering valuable stuff for yourself. In the end, there's nothing more fundamental than the laws of motion, and motion is all about perspective. You change your thoughts, then you change your world and whats posible within it.

But the act of **changing thoughts** requires learning: and what is learning but leaving something old to adopt something new.
